## Evaluation material

In this branch, you will find the code and the relevant evaluation material used for our paper accepted at NDSS 2025. The data for the bug finding experiments is divided into three directories:

- `open/`: this directory contains the compiled fuzzing harnesses and the bugs found in the OSS-Fuzz projects we tested.
- `proprietary/`: this directory contains the binaries and the bugs found in the proprietary software we tested.
- `fts/`: this directory contains the data about performance and accuracy experiments.

All the data can be accessed from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EXnyuAXGlGyR-mMzj5X1cTfFV-9JP-Ee?usp=sharing).
